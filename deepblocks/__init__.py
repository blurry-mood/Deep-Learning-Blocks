""" The **deepblocks** package is a collection of useful PyTorch modules found in deep learning research papers.

It contains:
    - layers and blocks of layers,
    - activation functions,
    - differentiable loss functions,
    - regularizer loss functions,
    - optimizers,
    - self-supervised trainers, that take a PyTorch model and pretrains it using a specific method.
